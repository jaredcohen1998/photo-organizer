# photo-organizer
A quick short overnight project to read metadata from a folder of images and organizes it into YYYY-MM-DD directories. This was a quick project to quickly bulk organize old family photos. I used the library metadata-extractor v2.16.0 to read the metadata

All base code was taken from the metadata-extractor library. Main function Source/com/drew/Main.java was written by me.
